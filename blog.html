            <h1 class="text-center">Differences between var, let, and const</h1> <hr>
            <p>One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you. In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const  with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences between them that I'll point out.</p>
            <h4>var: </h4>
            <p>Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.</p>
            <h4>let:</h4>
            <p>let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
            <h4>const</h4>
            <p>Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">What is difference between arrow function and normal function?</h1> <hr>
            <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center ">map(), forEach(), find(), filter()</h1> <hr>
            <p>The first difference between map() and forEach() is the returning value. The forEach() method returns undefined and map() returns a new array with the transformed elements. Even if they do the same job, the returning value remains different.</p>
